## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. **TYFCB Performance Highlighting** ✅

**What was added:**
- **Total TYFCB column**: Now shows Red/Orange/Green highlighting based on chapter average
  - 🟢 Green: >= 1.75x chapter average (Excellent)
  - 🟠 Orange: 0.75x - 1.75x chapter average (Good/Average)
  - 🔴 Red: < 0.5x chapter average (Needs Attention)

**Special feature:**
- **Member names highlighted in RED** if Outside TYFCB > 2x Inside TYFCB
  - This flags members who are giving more business outside the chapter than inside
  - Easy visual indicator for members who need encouragement to refer internally

**File**: `backend/bni/services/aggregation_service.py` lines 1651-1704

## 📈 Before vs. After

### Before:
```
| Member | Data | Data | ███ | M1 | M2 | ███ | M3 | M4 |
|        |      |      | ███ |    |    | ███ |    |    |
| John   |  10  |  20  | ███ |  5 |  5 | ███ |  5 |  5 |
```
- Black columns waste space
- No borders on data
- Hard to distinguish sections
- TYFCB had no performance colors

### After:
```
┌────────┬──────┬──────╫────┬────╫────┬────┐
│ Member │ Data │ Data ║ M1 │ M2 ║ M3 │ M4 │
├────────┼──────┼──────╫────┼────╫────┼────┤
│ John   │  10  │  20  ║  5 │  5 ║  5 │  5 │
└────────┴──────┴──────╨────┴────╨────┴────┘
```
- Thick borders (║) replace black columns
- Thin borders around all cells
- Clear section separation
- TYFCB with full highlighting
- Member names flagged if Outside > 2x Inside

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

If you want to take this even further in the future:

1. **Excel Native Tables** (not implemented)
   - Could add native Excel Table formatting to Summary page
   - Would enable built-in filtering and alternating row colors
   - May conflict with some formatting

2. **Conditional Formatting Icons** (not implemented)
   - Could add traffic light icons (🔴🟠🟢) to performance cells
   - Excel native feature for visual indicators

3. **Data Bars** (not implemented)
   - Visual bars in cells to show relative values
   - Good for TYFCB amounts

4. **Sparklines** (not implemented)
   - Mini charts showing trends across months
   - Could show monthly TYFCB trend for each member

## 📝 Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- File size remains similar (borders add minimal overhead)
- Performance is not impacted
- All color schemes maintained from specification.md
