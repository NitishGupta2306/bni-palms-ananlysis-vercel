# Transaction Management Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ Comprehensive transaction management implemented

---

## Overview

The BNI PALMS application uses Django's `@transaction.atomic` decorator and context manager to ensure data integrity across all multi-step operations. Transactions guarantee that either all database operations complete successfully, or all changes are rolled back, preventing partial updates and data corruption.

---

## Transaction Strategy

### When to Use Transactions

Apply `@transaction.atomic` to operations that:

1. **Create multiple related records** (e.g., member + analytics data)
2. **Update multiple fields/records** (e.g., member name + normalized_name)
3. **Delete records with cascading effects** (e.g., chapter deletion cascades to members)
4. **Perform validation before saving** (prevent invalid data from being partially saved)
5. **Execute bulk operations** (e.g., bulk_create, bulk_update)

### Transaction Types

#### 1. Decorator Pattern (Recommended for ViewSet Methods)
```python
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def create(self, request):
    # All operations in this method run in a single transaction
    member = Member.objects.create(...)
    member.analytics.create(...)
    return Response(...)
```

#### 2. Context Manager Pattern (Recommended for Service Methods)
```python
def process_data(self):
    with transaction.atomic():
        # All operations in this block run in a single transaction
        chapter = Chapter.objects.create(...)
        Member.objects.bulk_create([...])
```

## Current Implementation

### ✅ ViewSets with Transaction Management

#### **Member Operations** (`members/views.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `create()` | 53 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures member creation and normalization complete or rollback |
| `update()` | 100 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures all field updates and name recalculation complete or rollback |
| `destroy()` | 128 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures member and all analytics (referrals, OTOs, TYFCBs) delete together |

```python
@transaction.atomic
def create(self, request, chapter_pk=None):
    """Create member with automatic name normalization."""
    chapter = Chapter.objects.get(id=chapter_pk)
    service = MemberService()
    member, created = service.get_or_create_member(
        chapter=chapter,
        first_name=request.data.get('first_name'),
        last_name=request.data.get('last_name'),
        # ... other fields
    )
    return Response(serializer.data, status=HTTP_201_CREATED if created else HTTP_200_OK)
```

#### **Report Operations** (`reports/views.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `destroy()` | 123 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures report and cascaded MemberMonthlyStats delete together |
| `reset_all_data()` | 549 | `with transaction.atomic()` | Ensures ALL deletions succeed or ALL rollback |

```python
@transaction.atomic
def destroy(self, request, pk=None, chapter_pk=None):
    """Delete monthly report atomically."""
    monthly_report = MonthlyReport.objects.get(id=pk, chapter=chapter)
    monthly_report.delete()  # Cascades to MemberMonthlyStats
    return Response({"message": "Monthly report deleted successfully"})
```

---

### ✅ Services with Transaction Management

#### **Member Service** (`bni/services/member_service.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `get_or_create_member()` | 23 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures member creation and name normalization complete or rollback |
| `update_member()` | 97 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures all field updates and name recalculation complete or rollback |
| `delete_member()` | 157 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures member and all analytics delete together |

**Example:**
```python
@staticmethod
@transaction.atomic
def update_member(member_id: int, **kwargs) -> Tuple[Member, bool]:
    """
    Update member with automatic normalized_name recalculation.
    Uses @transaction.atomic to ensure all updates and validation
    complete successfully or rollback entirely.
    """
    member = Member.objects.get(id=member_id)

    # Update fields
    for field, value in kwargs.items():
        if field in allowed_fields:
            setattr(member, field, value)

    # Recalculate normalized_name if names changed
    if name_changed:
        member.normalized_name = Member.normalize_name(...)

    # Validate and save (all or nothing)
    member.full_clean()
    member.save()

    return member, updated
```

#### **Chapter Service** (`bni/services/chapter_service.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `update_chapter()` | 68 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures all field updates and validation complete or rollback |
| `delete_chapter()` | 110 | `@transaction.atomic` | Ensures chapter and all members/reports delete together |

#### **Excel Processor Service** (`bni/services/excel/processor.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `process_monthly_reports_batch()` | 456 | `with transaction.atomic()` | Ensures all analytics deletion, report creation, and data processing complete or rollback |
| `process_monthly_report()` | 865 | `with transaction.atomic()` | (Deprecated) Single-file processing with transaction |

**Example:**
```python
def process_monthly_reports_batch(self, slip_audit_files, ...):
    """Process multiple weekly files into single monthly report."""
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Step 1: Clear ALL analytics for clean aggregation
        Referral.objects.filter(giver__chapter=self.chapter).delete()
        OneToOne.objects.filter(member1__chapter=self.chapter).delete()
        TYFCB.objects.filter(receiver__chapter=self.chapter).delete()

        # Step 2: Delete existing monthly report
        MonthlyReport.objects.filter(chapter=self.chapter, month_year=month_year).delete()

        # Step 3: Create new report and process all files
        monthly_report = MonthlyReport.objects.create(...)

        # All of above succeeds together, or all rolls back
```

#### **Bulk Upload Service** (`bni/services/bulk_upload_service.py`)

| Method | Line | Transaction Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `process_region_summary()` | 86 | `with transaction.atomic()` | Ensures all chapter and member creation/updates complete or rollback |

**Example:**
```python
def process_region_summary(self, file):
    """Process regional PALMS summary with bulk operations."""
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Step 1: Bulk create chapters
        Chapter.objects.bulk_create(chapters_to_create, ignore_conflicts=True)

        # Step 2: Bulk create members
        Member.objects.bulk_create(members_to_create, ignore_conflicts=True)

        # Step 3: Bulk update existing members
        Member.objects.bulk_update(members_to_update, ['first_name', 'last_name'], batch_size=100)

        # All bulk operations succeed together, or all roll back
```

## Transaction Boundaries

### What Gets Rolled Back?

When an exception occurs within a transaction:

1. **All database operations** (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) are reverted
2. **Database state** returns to pre-transaction state
3. **File system changes** are NOT rolled back (save files before DB operations)
4. **External API calls** are NOT rolled back

### Example: Rollback Behavior

```python
@transaction.atomic
def create_member_with_analytics(request):
    # Operation 1: Create member ✓
    member = Member.objects.create(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")

    # Operation 2: Create referral ✓
    Referral.objects.create(giver=member, receiver=other_member)

    # Operation 3: Validation fails ✗
    if not validate_email(request.data.get('email')):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid email")

    # Transaction ROLLS BACK:
    # - Member is deleted
    # - Referral is deleted
    # - Database returns to original state
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use @transaction.atomic for View Methods

```python
class MemberViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    @transaction.atomic
    def create(self, request):
        # All operations in this method are atomic
        ...
```

### 2. Use Context Manager for Complex Logic

```python
def process_data(self):
    # Setup (outside transaction)
    data = prepare_data()

    # Critical section (inside transaction)
    with transaction.atomic():
        Chapter.objects.create(...)
        Member.objects.bulk_create([...])
```

### 3. Minimize Transaction Scope

```python
# ❌ BAD: Long-running operations in transaction
@transaction.atomic
def process_file(file):
    data = parse_large_file(file)  # Slow, locks database
    process_data(data)

# ✅ GOOD: Only DB operations in transaction
def process_file(file):
    data = parse_large_file(file)  # Fast, no locks
    with transaction.atomic():
        process_data(data)  # Quick DB operations
```

### 4. Handle Exceptions Properly

```python
@transaction.atomic
def create_member(request):
    try:
        member = Member.objects.create(...)
        return Response(serializer.data)
    except ValidationError as e:
        # Transaction automatically rolls back
        return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=400)
```

### 5. Don't Suppress Errors

```python
# ❌ BAD: Suppressing errors prevents rollback
@transaction.atomic
def create_member(request):
    try:
        member = Member.objects.create(...)
    except Exception:
        pass  # Transaction won't roll back!

# ✅ GOOD: Let errors propagate
@transaction.atomic
def create_member(request):
    member = Member.objects.create(...)  # Error triggers rollback
```

---

## Testing Transaction Rollback

### Test Case Example

```python
from django.test import TestCase, TransactionTestCase
from django.db import transaction

class TransactionTest(TransactionTestCase):
    def test_rollback_on_error(self):
        """Test that operations roll back on error."""
        initial_count = Member.objects.count()

        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):
            with transaction.atomic():
                Member.objects.create(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
                Member.objects.create(first_name="", last_name="")  # Invalid

        # Assert rollback occurred
        self.assertEqual(Member.objects.count(), initial_count)
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Transaction Overhead

- **Minimal overhead** for simple operations (< 1ms)
- **Significant benefit** for data integrity
- **Locks database rows** during transaction (keep scope small)

### Bulk Operations

Always use transactions with bulk operations:

```python
with transaction.atomic():
    # 100x faster than individual creates with better integrity
    Member.objects.bulk_create([...], batch_size=100)
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Create with Related Objects

```python
@transaction.atomic
def create_chapter_with_members(request):
    chapter = Chapter.objects.create(name="New Chapter")
    members = [Member(chapter=chapter, ...) for data in request.data]
    Member.objects.bulk_create(members)
    return Response({"id": chapter.id})
```

### Pattern 2: Update with Validation

```python
@transaction.atomic
def update_member(member_id, **kwargs):
    member = Member.objects.get(id=member_id)
    for field, value in kwargs.items():
        setattr(member, field, value)
    member.full_clean()  # Validate before committing
    member.save()
    return member
```

### Pattern 3: Delete with Cascade

```python
@transaction.atomic
def delete_chapter(chapter_id):
    chapter = Chapter.objects.get(id=chapter_id)
    member_count = chapter.members.count()
    chapter.delete()  # Cascades to members, reports, analytics
    return {"members_deleted": member_count}
```
