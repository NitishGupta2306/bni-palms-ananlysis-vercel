5. [ ] Test Export button
6. [ ] Select multiple members with checkboxes
7. [ ] Verify bulk delete button shows count
8. [ ] Test edit and delete buttons (they won't work, but should render)

**Expected Result:** UI renders correctly, no console errors

---

#### Comparison Tab (10 min)

**Expected Result:** All functionality works, no missing icons or components

---

### Priority 2: Type Safety & Navigation (Test If Time)

#### Chapter Routes & Navigation (10 min)
**Why:** Modified regex pattern and removed unused imports

**Test Steps:**
1. [ ] Navigate to landing page `/`
2. [ ] Login to a chapter
3. [ ] Verify URL changes to `/chapter/{chapterId}`
4. [ ] Click on a member name
5. [ ] Verify URL changes to `/chapter/{chapterId}/members/{memberName}`
6. [ ] Use browser back button

9. [ ] Refresh page while on chapter detail page

**Expected Result:**
- URLs parse correctly
- Navigation works smoothly
- No redirect loops

---

#### Unified Dashboard - Member Display (5 min)
**Why:** Changed type casting from `any` to proper type guard

**Test Steps:**
1. [ ] Navigate to a chapter dashboard
2. [ ] Switch to "Members" tab
3. [ ] Verify all member names display correctly
4. [ ] Check for any "Unknown" member names (shouldn't appear unless data is malformed)
5. [ ] Check browser console for type errors

**Expected Result:** All member names display correctly, no console errors

---

#### Chapter Info Tab (5 min)
**Why:** Removed unused imports

**Test Steps:**

3. [ ] Verify file processes correctly
4. [ ] Check that member names are sanitized properly

**Expected Result:** Files process correctly, special characters handled

---

### Priority 4: Protected Routes (5 min)
**Why:** Removed unused `useEffect` import

**Test Steps:**
1. [ ] Try accessing `/admin` without admin authentication
2. [ ] Try accessing `/chapter/{id}` without chapter authentication
3. [ ] Verify redirects to login page work
4. [ ] Login and verify access is granted

**Expected Result:** Authentication protection still works correctly

---

## Regression Testing (Quick Smoke Test)

If you have time, run through these quick checks:

### Core User Flows (10 min each)
1. [ ] **Upload Flow**
   - Login to chapter
   - Upload PALMS report
   - Verify data processes
   - View generated matrices

2. [ ] **Comparison Flow**
   - Select two months
   - Generate comparison
   - Download Excel report
   - Verify data is correct

3. [ ] **Admin Flow**
   - Login as admin
   - View all chapters
   - View all members
   - Update security settings

---

## Known Issues (DO NOT Test - Not Fixed)

These issues were intentionally skipped as "too critical" or "too complex":

- ❌ Member Edit Button (shows alert, doesn't work)
- ❌ Member Delete Button (shows confirm, doesn't actually delete)
- ❌ Bulk Member Delete (clears selections, doesn't delete)
- ❌ Authentication not implemented on backend endpoints
- ❌ Passwords stored in plain text
- ❌ Large component files not split
- ❌ N+1 query issues

**Note:** These are documented in the existing todo files and should be addressed separately.
