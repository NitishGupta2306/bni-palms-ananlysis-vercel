## Best Practices for Using These Prompts

### 1. Single-Task Focus
Each agent should work on ONE specific issue at a time. Break large tasks into subtasks.

**Example:**
- Instead of: "Fix all performance issues"
- Use: "Add virtualization to matrix-display.tsx for 50+ member lists"

### 2. Clear Handoffs
When chaining agents, explicitly pass context:
```
UI-Agent completed virtualization. Database-Agent should now add indexes for the queries used in the matrix display. Relevant queries are in backend/analytics/views.py lines 45-78.
```

### 3. Verification Loops
After major changes, use this pattern:
1. Agent implements change
2. Review agent verifies (can be same Claude instance with different prompt)
3. Original agent refines based on feedback

### 4. Parallel Work
These agents can work in parallel on independent issues:
- UI-Agent: Frontend components
- Backend-Agent: API endpoints
- Database-Agent: Schema optimization
- Documentation-Agent: Writing docs

### 5. Context Management
Keep context focused:
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Include only relevant error messages
- Provide specific examples of the issue
- Link to recommendation file for full context

## Prompt Engineering Tips Applied

These prompts follow Anthropic's best practices:

1. **Clear Role Definition** - Each prompt starts with explicit role and expertise
2. **Context Setting** - Provides necessary background about the codebase
3. **Workflow Structure** - Breaks down the approach into clear steps
4. **Constraints** - Explicitly states what to avoid
5. **Output Format** - Specifies exactly what to provide when complete
6. **Single Goal** - Each agent has one clear focus area
7. **Self-Correction** - Encourages asking questions before proceeding

**Chain-of-Thought Pattern:**
Each prompt encourages the agent to:
1. Understand the problem (read recommendations)
2. Clarify requirements (ask questions)
3. Plan approach (create implementation plan)
4. Execute (make changes)
5. Verify (test and validate)
6. Report (document what was done)

This creates a natural verification loop and prevents rushed implementations.
